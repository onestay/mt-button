# Project Title

Button interface for Marathon-Tools used to communicate with the big ass buttons for starting and stopping time.
## Getting Started

```
yarn
node index.js
```
It will create the WebSocket connection and make http requests on localhost:3000

### Prerequisites

You need to at least have the [Marathon-Tools API running](https://github.com/onestay/MarathonTools-API). It defaults to running on port 3001. Change the env var on the API to listen to port 3000 instead.
